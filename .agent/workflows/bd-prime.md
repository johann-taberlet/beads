** ALWAYS ** start the session by executing in bash 'bd prime' as the first action you take.
Then strictly follow the described workflow to achieve one and only one task.
Before closing the bead and commiting, you **MUST** lint/format and build the project without any errors nor warnings.
Then end the bead workflow to close your bead and commit/sync.
